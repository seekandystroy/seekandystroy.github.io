    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="andy_2022.jpg" style="width: 200px;" />

    <p>After several years as a software engineer, it was quite clear to me that people are the core of any company, and
        that helping them grow is what really moves the company forward. Helping those around me grow and driving
        delivery became my main interests, so I made a career move to engineering management.</p>

    <p>Currently I'm working as a Senior Engineering Manager at <a href="https://astrada.co/">Astrada</a>, where I have
        responsibilities of people management and delivery.</p>

    <p>As a software engineer, I worked mostly on back-end. This website reflects that, who needs CSS and JS right?
