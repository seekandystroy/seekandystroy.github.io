    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="andy_2022.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/>

    <p>After 7 years as a software engineer, it was quite clear to me that people are the core of any company, and that helping them grow is what really moves the company forward. Helping those around me grow and driving delivery became my main interests, so I made a career move to engineering management.</p>

    <p>Currently I'm working as an Engineering Manager at <a href="https://fidelapi.com/">Fidel API</a>, where I have responsibilities of people management and delivery.</p>

    <p>As a software engineer, I worked mostly on the back-end. This website reflects that, who needs CSS and JS right? Inspired by <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">the motherfucking website</a>.</p>
